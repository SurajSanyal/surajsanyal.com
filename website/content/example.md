# This was read from a file

## You have access to Markdown like you would anywhere else.

### But it will be entirely up to you how the Markdown is rendered on the page using CSS styling.

# At the top of the Markdown file is metadata. You can use it in your templating.

## For example, the name of this tab in the browser is set by the title key in this Markdown page's metadata.
