# This Keyboard Feeds People
I watched a podcast with Seth Godin. 
He seemed fed up with people trying to pitch him business ideas. 
If I were to describe his sentiment from memory, it sounded a bit like this:

> “You want to know how to tell if something’s a business? 
> Try one run. 
> Let’s use coffee. 
> If I can drive to New York, and get a bag of locally roasted coffee, and drive back to my office, and sell the coffee for a profit, that’s a business. 
> Everyone’s coming up with marketing and a strategy and a vision before they’ve even tested if the idea’s worth pursuing.”

In that same podcast, he talked about Tom’s Shoes, and how the brand had 2 distinct ingredients:

1. A visible differentiator (the logo on the heel) to start a conversation
2. A story that signaled status: “when I bought these shoes, a pair was given to someone who needed them.”

I walked around my office that day and noticed Owala water bottles on top of desks. Colorful. 
Custom. 
Cute little flip top lid.

And I figured: “what if I made something that lived on your desk, that you could tell someone you were proud to pay for?”

TKFP was born.

I made custom keyboards, and, instead of charging for profit, I asked my customers to donate an amount of their choice to Elijah’s Promise, a food bank in New Brunswick.

It was perfect in my head. 
Just as custom and colorful as an Owala. 
Perfectly suited to the needs of a new grad working in tech. 
Visible every day in the office.

Now I just needed to learn how to pitch it.
